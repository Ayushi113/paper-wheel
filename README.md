# paper-wheel
A python-based visualization tool for technical papers. You need to just install the turtle package, and run this code exactly as I describe here.

1. Open the terminal
2. Go to the directory with the location of the code.
3. Type python foundations_project.py
4. You will see a "welcome screen".

5. Select any three authors with this input
1), 3), 4)
digit bracket comma space

6.And course issues like this:
[Theories]
square-bracket course-issue square-bracket

To visualize your own readings, you could summarize your authors in 5 points.
Then, tag each point with any issue. Like [Methodologies], [Results].. etc. You could then see a nice visualization, of 3 authors at a time. 

We are working on taking text files as input, so you don't have to meddle with the code in the future. But as of now, feel free to replace our authors with yours.
